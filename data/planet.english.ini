# Planet configuration file based on the 'fancy' Planet 2.0 example.

# This illustrates some of Planet's fancier features with example.

# Every planet needs a [Planet] section
[Planet]
# name: Your planet's name
# link: Link to the main page
# owner_name: Your name
# owner_email: Your e-mail address
name = Planet Sofia Valley
link = http://planet.sofiavalley.com/

# feed_timeout: number of seconds to wait for any given feed

# Hackergotchi default size.
# If we want to put a face alongside a feed, and it's this size, we
# can omit these variables.
facewidth = 65
faceheight = 85


# Any other section defines a feed to subscribe to.  The section title
# (in the []s) is the URI of the feed itself.  A section can also be
# have any of the following options:
# 
# name: Name of the feed (defaults to the title found in the feed)
#
# Additionally any other option placed here will be available in
# the template (prefixed with channel_ for the Items loop).  We use
# this trick to make the faces work -- this isn't something Planet
# "natively" knows about.  Look at fancy-examples/index.html.tmpl
# for the flip-side of this.

## NB: Keep this list sorted by name
